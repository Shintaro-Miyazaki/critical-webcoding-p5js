critical-webcoding-p5js
=======================

A collection of exercises from a
[course](<https://github.com/s4ac/s4ac.github.io/tree/master/classes/2018HS%40HGK_IXDM>
) directed by [Yann Martins](https://github.com/Yyyyaaaannnnoooo) and me in
Autumn/Winter 2018 as a preparation for upcoming courses.

To test the project download the repository and open the index.html files inside
the folders with a browser.

 

mouse_tracker simple
====================

Mouse tracking starts upon clicking on „rec“ and is stopped/revealed when
clicking on „play“. The key code is on sketch.js, which is inside the folder
„js“. With this code we introduced the Document Object Model (DOM) as a way to
interface with HTML and XML documents. A DOM is an object-oriented
representation (a model) of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting
language such as JavaScript. Here the DOM principle is used to access the
buttons.
